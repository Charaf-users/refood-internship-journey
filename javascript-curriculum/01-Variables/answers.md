Task 3:
cannot change value of intershipyear because is const not a variables and is constante value.

Bonus Discussion Questions :

1) the diffrence between var and let and const is var and let anr variables can change the value any time and every time do you want , Not like const are constant value you cannot change the value .

2) you should  prefer use const but if you khnow the value not change but if you khnow the value change you prefer use let beacuse is variables can change any time you want .

3) We don’t use var much in modern JavaScript because it can cause problems. It’s better to use let or const because they are safer and easier to understand like :
      1. Hoisting Problem.
      2. Block Scope Issue.
      and are more problems thats way you avoid var and use let .
